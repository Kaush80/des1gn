## Observer Pattern

---

### Purpose

- Provides the ability for a subject to notify a set of "observers" about changes to the subject
- Used to maintain loose coupling between elements ofa system that interact with each other

### Scenarios

- Systems where state changes of a subject cannot be predicted and the list of interested "listeners" cannot be known in advance or changes during runtime.

---

## Iterator Pattern

---

### Purpose

- Describes a way of accessing the elements contained within an object without exposing the underlying implementation of the container

### Scenarios

- Useful for objects that expose collections of elements, for example, a library object that keeps track of publications such as books, magazines, and DVDs
